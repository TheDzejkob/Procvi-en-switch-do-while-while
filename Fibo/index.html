    <label id="toollabel">"See, I think drugs have done some good things for us, I really do"
"And if you don't believe drugs have done good things for us, do me a favor"
"Go home tonight and take all your albums, all your tapes, and all your CDs and burn 'em"
"'Cause you know what? The musicians who've made all that great music"
"That's enhanced your lives throughout the years?"
"Real fucking high on drugs"
"Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration"
"That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively"
"There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves"
"Here's Tom with the weather"
"It's not a war on drugs, it's a war on personal freedom, that's what it is, okay?"
"Keep that in mind at all times, thank you"
Dreaming of that face again
It's bright and blue and shimmering
Grinning wide and comforting me with it's three warm and wild eyes
On my back and tumbling
Down that hole and back again
Rising up and wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye
In
Out
In
Out
A child's rhyme stuck in my head
It said that life is but a dream
I've spent so many years in question
To find I've known this all along
So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running?
Shrouding all the ground around me
Is this holy crow above me
Black as holes within a memory
And blue as our new second sun
I stick my hand into his shadow
To pull the pieces from the sand
Which I attempt to reassemble
To see just who I might have been
I do not recognize the vessel
But the eyes seem so familiar
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
Singing one familiar song
So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding
And you thought that I had run away
Chasing the tail of dogma
I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye and there we were
So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding from me
And you thought that I had run away
Chasing a trail of smoke and reason
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye</label>
